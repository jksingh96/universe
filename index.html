				<h2>The Big Bang</h2>
				<p>The Universe began to expand at this moment. The Universe is thought to have come into existence as a singularity. Singularities are basically areas where the the pressure and temperature is so great that matter is compressed to an infinite density. This is just a basic description of a Singularity since they are not well understood and some scientists even disagree with this theory. This singularity began to expand and the universe was born.<p>

				<h2>Foundations of the Universe</h2>
				<p>After a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded quickly into a very large size and many iportant partices and elements were created. Protons were created and electrons and antielectrons. Also helium was produced from hydrogen. Also during this time many forces became distinct such as gravity. Before it was so hot and dense that the 4 forces could not be seperated.</p>

				<h2> Recombination Era</h2>
				<p>The density of the universe decreased and Hydrogen and helium atoms began to form. Electrons were also captured by hydrogen and helium ions to form electrically netural atoms.</p>

				<p>Another theory of how the Universe will "end". The expansion of the Universe eventually reverses and the Universe would begin to contract. The Universe would become hot and dense again eventually leading to the Universe collapsing into a singularity. </p>

				<p>Atoms begin to fall apart as protons and neutrons begin to decay into electrons and positrons. Eventually only Blackholes are left, but they too will dissappear as they emit Hawking Radiation.<p>

				<h2>Heat Death</h2>
				<p>Black holes evaporate around this time and the Universe now only consists of subatomic particles and photons. These are seperated by large distances and nothing else would occur in the Universe from now on. There would be no new events so it would impossible to determine the past and present. This can be considered as the end of time. This is considered to be the ultimate fate of the Universe.</p>
